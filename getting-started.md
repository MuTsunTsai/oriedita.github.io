## Saving

When saving you have to choose between two different save types. Either one has their own advantages.

<dl>
<dt>.ori</dt>
<dd>You can save files using the Oriedita file format .ori, this saves the creasepattern, customized colors and the camera position. This format is recommended when developing a new crease pattern as loading it brings you back to the same state as you left it.</dd>
<dt>.cp</dt>
<dd>You can also use the .cp format to save files, this file format only saves creases (so no circles or state). But this format is more lightweight and portable and should be used to share a crease pattern with someone else. This format can also be opened in other origami crease pattern software.</dd>
