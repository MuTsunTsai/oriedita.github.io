# Oriedita

_Oriedita is a fork of Orihime オリヒメ and not affiliated with the original version._

Oriedita is a computer program used for drawing origami crease patterns. It comes with a wide range of tools to help you draw crease patterns.

Oriedita can simulate folding a crease pattern and show if a crease pattern is flat-foldable, and if it is, show a folded version of the crease pattern.

## Download Oriedita

[Download the latest version from the Releases page.](https://github.com/oriedita/oriedita/releases)

## Saving

<dl>
<dt>.ori</dt>
<dd>You can save files using the Oriedita file format .ori, this saves the creasepattern, customized colors and the camera position. This format is recommended when developing a new crease pattern as loading it brings you back to the same state as you left it.</dd>
<dt>.cp</dt>
<dd>You can also use the .cp format to save files, this file format only saves creases (so no circles or state). But this format is more lightweight and portable and should be used to share a crease pattern with someone else. This format can also be opened in other origami crease pattern software.</dd>
