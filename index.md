# Oriedita

[_Oriedita is a fork of Orihime オリヒメ and not affiliated with the original version._](./orihime.md)

Oriedita is a computer program used for drawing origami crease patterns. It comes with a wide range of tools to help you draw crease patterns.

Oriedita can simulate folding a crease pattern and show if a crease pattern is flat-foldable, and if it is, show a folded version of the crease pattern.
