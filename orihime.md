# Orihime

Oriedita has much to thank Orihime for, as it is the basis of the software.

Orihime is an awesome tool that is used by origami designers to design new origami models. Orihime is developed by Meguro (MT777) and can be downloaded from [mt777.html.xdomain.jp](http://mt777.html.xdomain.jp/). Undertrox developed orihimeMod, which adds some extra features to the Orihime software, this version can be downloaded from [undertrox/orihimeMod](https://github.com/undertrox/orihimeMod)
